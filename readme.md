This is a list of lessons learned from lived experience. It [began as an email](https://mailchi.mp/09872b3d2a05/57) in 2020, and is now here for posterity and further development.

1.  People giving you free advice are _talking to themselves_, not you.
2.  Be a good owner to your pet: understand their dietary requirements in neurotic detail.
3.  Change lanes.
4.  Burn bridges deliberately, never by accident. Cut out cancerous people quickly, actively seek out better ones. It sounds horrendous and you needn't be proud of it.
5.  Take time off. Use it to travel. If possible, choose destinations seldom visited by people of your own nationality.
6.  Actively pursue media that targets people other than you. _Don't stick to your demographic_.
7.  Everyone who plays an instrument wishes they had learned a different one.
8.  Consuming is not creating.
9.  Don't work for free. _Time is more scarce than money_. Treat talking about work as work. Treat thinking about work as work.
10.  When you find good shoes, buy three pairs. Don't buy bad shoes.
11.  Be acutely aware of other people's role in your own mental health. Relish supporters, demolish detractors. Also pay attention to your role in the mental health of others. Be what you'd want.
12.  Beware of very attractive people.
13.  Invest heavily in good friends. Put the effort in. Recognise the distinction between friends and drinking buddies.
14.  Get to the point.
15.  In case of debt crises, talk to creditors early. For all their faults, banks are experienced at managing debts, and they have an interest in you managing yours.
16.  Write. Then [edit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/smarter-living/how-to-edit-your-own-writing.html).
17.  Learn to _accept compliments_ without batting them away. People who offer compliments deserve thanks.
18.  Seek out difficult things.
19.  Make a point of writing down what you did; bullet-points will do. Write down what you intend to do, whether you end up doing it or not. To-do lists are less interesting than might-do lists.
20.  New Year's Eve is dismal shit; avoid mandated celebration. To thine own self be true.
21.  Talk about mental health as often as you might about physical health. People need people to be open about it, just as they do about, say, diet and exercise.
22.  _Beware of anything seemingly good for the planet that also involves making a purchase_.
23.  Winding up knowing nothing would be a better outcome than knowing everything.
24.  Personality beats originality.
25.  _Seek out different colas_. Green Cola and Karma Cola are great; [Tirola Kola](https://www.tirolakola.at) is excellent.
26.  Games are time well spent.
27.  If you take a hundred photographs or paint a hundred pictures or write a hundred poems, at least one will probably be good.
28.  Accept your limitations. Know your boundaries. Admit when you're ill.
29.  Possessions own you. _Accumulating stuff is a bad goal_.
30.  Nobody had an original thought while looking at a screen.
31.  Iterate. Start small. Smaller than that.
32.  Don't obsess about presentation. Substance beats style.
33.  Many tools, particularly digital ones, hamper your ability to make progress. Get as far as you can without the distraction of font sizes.
34.  Beware of indulgences. they're rarely the acts of self-care they appear to be.
35.  Readiness and paranoia are not the same thing. You can get a grip and also let go.
36.  Be vulnerable. It's good not to know what to do.
37.  Any success, no matter how slight, is worthy of celebration, no matter how small.
38.  _Networking is nonsense_. You don't meet interesting people by doing boring things.
39.  Everything is worthy of curiosity. But not necessarily all at once. Pick your battles.
40.  The thing about imposter syndrome is everyone's in the same boat. You chanced your way here, as did everyone else. There's no grand plan, only blind luck. Get comfortable with being just as much an imposter as everyone else.
